              The Caramelo dog emerged in Brazil from crossings between
              mixed-breed dogs, which were common on the streets. These dogs
              reproduced randomly, without any control or selection. Over time,
              they developed similar physical and behavioral characteristics,
              giving rise to the breed. Caramelo has become the favorite dog
              breed of Brazilians, thanks to its prominence on social media,
              entertaining many people. They are very intelligent and loyal,
              capable of doing anything to please their owner.
